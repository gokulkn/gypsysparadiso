       But if we apply it to ALL items, they all move left. 
       To make a seamless loop, we need the container to scroll or items to translate.
       Since we cloned items, we have [Item1, Item2, Item1, Item2].
       We want to move left until the first set is gone, then reset.
       The distance is -50% of the TOTAL scroll width if we doubled it?
       Actually, standard marquee moves the track.
